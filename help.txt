# Welcome to the nodebot workshop

We're going to learn the basics of the `johnny-five` api, as a series of code challenges.

`johnny-five` is an api for working with Arduino and other rapid prototyping boards, but...

**You _don't_ need an Arduino for this workshop.**

The workshop will pose a challenge, and will test your code.
The low level code to talk to the Arduino is stubbed out.

**You _will_ be writing working, executable `johnny-five` code.**

Each of your solutions can be run directly as a `node` program.
Wire up an Arduino, connect the USB and you can see you solution run for real.
